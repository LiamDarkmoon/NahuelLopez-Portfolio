    title: "About me",
    text: "I’m a web and UX designer with an engineering mindset. I don’t build pages — I design systems. I focus on creating digital products that are clear, scalable, and built for real people, not vanity metrics. I work at the intersection of design and development, where user experience, architecture, and performance become a single discipline. I care deeply about clarity, structure, and intentional simplicity. Good design solves problems. Good engineering makes sure they don’t come back.",
